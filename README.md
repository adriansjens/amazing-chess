## Introduction

### ❓  The what, why, and how of Amazing Chess

Amazing chess is a console application intended to showcase modern principles of object-oriented programming. It contains all the established rulesets of traditional chess expressed by using C# logical programming. The game is played using commands in a CLI (command line interface).

### ▶️ How to play Amazing Chess

The game is played through the command line. The program accepts inputs in a basic chess move format (e.g. e4xe5). It keeps track of your moves and displays them back to you after each succesful move. Currently, two players are required to play. An AI opponent is planned in the future.
